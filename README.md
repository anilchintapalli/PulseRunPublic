# PulseRun
The goal of this project is to create a program that can predict a user's predicted biometric features and average/max heart rate for a future run based on these route features: Distance, Pace, Elevation gained, Elevation lost. This prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on the user's historical running data through either Garmin Connect or Strava (although Strava provides less features).

## Libraries and Equipment
* Tensorflow - This machine learning library allows us to train and run models. 
* pandas - Library for managing dataframes
* numpy - Library for array manipulation
* Flask - This framework will be used to build the API.
* Streamlit - This framework will be used to build the UI
* Keras - Library for neural network implementation
* Garmin Connect- This API wrapper allows access to a user's Garmin Connect activity data given they provide their associated email, password, start date, and end date. 
* SDV - Library to generate synthetic and evaluate the quality of that data
* Scikit Learn - Library for standardization of features before training
* Pytorch - Library for nerual network implementation (preferred over Keras because of warning supression and compatible versions
